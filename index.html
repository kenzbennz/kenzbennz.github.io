  <h1><p style="color:purple;">My favorite Cities</p></h1>
  <p>Los Angeles is one of my favorite cities. The reason behind this is because my Dad lives there but I also have spent 4 years attending <a href="http://www.grammyintheschools.com/programs/grammy-camp">Grammy Camp<a/> on USC's Campus."GRAMMY Camp is a 5-day nonresidential summer music industry program for high school students interested in having a career in music. Hosted by Belmont University in Nashville and USC Thornton School of Music in Los Angeles, students from across the country apply for one of the eight offered career tracks. GRAMMY Camp faculty of music professionals as well as guest industry professionals provide valuable insight to give the campers the best chance at achieving success in their chosen career"..</p>
  <p>Milan is second on the list of my favorite cities because almost of my family call Italy home. Summer of 2016 I went to Milan to visit my cousin who's following her dream by quitting her job and starting her own company she now has her own magazine called <a href="https://thefashionplatemag.com/"> The Fashion Plate.</a> It was a great experience being behind the scenes while she created her magazine.</p>
  <p>Last but not least Valencia, Spain is another city I cherish because in Summer of 2018 I hope to start a new life there attending <a href="https://valencia.berklee.edu/"> Berklee College of Music Valencia</a> Ever since I started Grammy Camp it opened my eyes that almost anything is possible. I go to work with the most talented indivduals in LA and being 1 of the selected 72 students out of thousands made me not want to stop there I needed to take it all the way to Valencia to learn a new culture, language and music.</p>
